# FashionMNIST Models

This project explores and compares three deep learning models built using PyTorch to classify clothing images from the FashionMNIST dataset:

- ðŸ”¹ **Linear Model** â€” A simple logistic regression approach using fully connected layers.
- ðŸ”¹ **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** â€” A deeper feedforward network with one or more hidden layers.
- ðŸ”¹ **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** â€” A convolution-based architecture suitable for image data.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
FashionMNIST consists of 28Ã—28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories such as shirts, shoes, trousers, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Goal
The goal is to evaluate and compare model performances in terms of accuracy, loss, and prediction quality on a held-out test set.

## ðŸ“¦ Tools & Libraries
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-mnist-models.git
